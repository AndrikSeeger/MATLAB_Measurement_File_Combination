# Combination and plotting of measurement files
This project was done within the MATLAB-Lecture at the DHBW Stuttgart. It includes a MATLAB-App with an extensive GUI to automatically convert multiple measurement files from random points in time to one time-continues measurement file. As an extension the combined file can be plotted within the app.
